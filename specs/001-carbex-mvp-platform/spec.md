## Executive Summary

Carbex is a SaaS platform that automates carbon footprint calculation for European SMEs (10-250 employees) subject to CSRD 2025, BEGES, LkSG (German Supply Chain Act), and EU sustainability reporting requirements. The platform's core innovation is "Zero-Input Carbon" - automatic data collection via Open Banking (PSD2), energy provider APIs, supplier integrations, and AI-powered multi-provider categorization, reducing manual data entry from 80% to under 20%.

**Target Markets**: Germany (P0 - Primary), France (P1), EU expansion (AT, CH, BE, NL, ES, IT)
**Core Value Proposition**: First carbon footprint in 2 hours (vs. 2-4 weeks traditional)

### Key Differentiators (Implemented)
- **Multi-Provider AI**: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek for transaction categorization
- **Open Banking PSD2**: Bridge (FR) + FinAPI (DE) for automatic transaction import
- **Energy API Integration**: Enedis + GRDF (FR) for real consumption data
- **Supplier Carbon Portal**: Scope 3 upstream data collection from supply chain
- **SSO/SAML Enterprise**: SAML 2.0 authentication for enterprise customers

### Edge Cases
- How does system handle duplicate transactions from bank and accounting import? Deduplication based on date, amount, and merchant.
- What happens when a user uploads malformed CSV? System validates format, reports specific errors, and rejects invalid rows.
- How does system handle transactions in foreign currencies? Convert to organization's base currency using exchange rate at transaction date.
- What happens when emission factors are updated mid-year? Historical calculations remain unchanged; new calculations use updated factors with audit trail.
- How does system handle multi-site organizations with different countries? Each site inherits country-specific emission factors.
- What happens when supplier doesn't respond to invitation? System sends reminders and uses estimated factors until actual data received.
- How does SSO handle user provisioning? Just-in-time provisioning on first login with IdP attributes.

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|------------|--------|
| Open Banking provider API changes | Medium | High | Abstract provider logic; monitor API changelogs | Mitigated |
| Low MCC code coverage | Medium | Medium | Multi-provider AI fallback; user feedback loop | Mitigated |
| GDPR/financial data compliance | Low | High | EU hosting; encrypt all sensitive data; audit trails | Mitigated |
| User adoption friction (bank OAuth) | Medium | Medium | Clear UX guidance; trust indicators; wizard flow | Mitigated |
| Emission factor accuracy disputes | Low | Medium | Document all sources; allow factor overrides | Mitigated |
| AI provider rate limits/costs | Medium | Medium | Multi-provider fallback; caching; quotas | Mitigated |
| Supplier portal low adoption | Medium | Medium | Reminders; incentives; estimated fallback | Monitoring |
